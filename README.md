# FS-ServerStatus

This version of FS-ServerStatus is stripped down for basic server needs.  
Feel free to add/remove commands that would suit your Discord community's needs.

Original version of FS-ServerStatus has been moved to [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/AnxietyisReal/FS-ServerStatus).

# Can I get an invite-link for your bot?

No. You cannot retrieve the bot's invite link from me. However the bot permissions are the following:  
`VIEW_CHANNEL`  
`SEND_MESSAGES`  
`READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY`  
`USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` _(Optional)_  
Or you can use this instead of above: `330752`

# How to initialize the folder and setup the bot?

1. Download the repository (Not teaching you how to)
2. Pick a suitable location to base your bot folder in
3. Initialize the folder/project with `npm i`
4. Setup `.env` file in root directory to your liking by customizing the `STARTUP=` but also importantly, insert the bot's token into `BOT_TOKEN=`.
5. Off you go! You can start the bot with `node .` inside Visual Studio Code. Starting the bot outside VSC is simply just figure it out.
